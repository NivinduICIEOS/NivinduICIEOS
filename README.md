I'm currently a technologist at [university of SJP](https://www.sjp.ac.lk/), Sri Lanka and a software programmer who is dreaming to be a full-stack developer and passionate about making contributing to open-source more accessible, creating technologies to elevate people. Some technologies I enjoy working with include awesome modules and libraries in languages that I really like to prefer. Parallelly, I do learn this field going through software designing, new technologies, cloning currently popular apps around the world, preferring language-oriented books and so on.
