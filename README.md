![Hey it's me!](https://github.com/coding-desk20/coding-desk20/blob/main/images/banner.png?raw=true)

I am a dedicated technologist currently working at the [University of Sri Jayewardenepura](https://www.sjp.ac.lk/) in Sri Lanka. As a software programmer, I am constantly striving to become a full-stack developer, and my passion lies in contributing to open-source projects that make technology more accessible and help elevate people's lives.

I am deeply fascinated by the possibilities of programming and enjoy working with a wide range of awesome modules and libraries, particularly in languages that I find myself drawn to. My passion for this field also extends to constantly learning new software designing concepts and exploring the latest technologies in the industry.

In addition to my programming work, I also enjoy taking on projects such as cloning popular apps from around the world and exploring language-oriented books to further broaden my horizons. My ultimate goal is to create innovative technologies that make a positive impact on society, and I am excited to continue my journey in this dynamic and ever-evolving field.
